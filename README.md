# Food Waste Management System

The **Food Waste Management System** is a web-based platform designed to reduce food wastage and help people in need. It connects **donors**, **NGOs**, and **volunteers** to enable real-time food donation and delivery. Donors can post details about the food such as type, quantity, expiry time, and pickup location. NGOs can view available food and claim it, while volunteers assist with timely pickup and delivery. The system provides real-time updates, status tracking, and a simple interface to ensure food reaches beneficiaries before it spoils.
